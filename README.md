<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The My Victoria component library aims to enable the publication of accessible maps, charts and user interface (UI)
elements to websites by content owners across Government. It includes a set of reusable UI components designed to
integrate with DDIâ€™s existing ecosystem of platforms and services; and supporting documentation and examples to assist
with their usage.

All components have been designed to align to Victorian Government design standards and branding; and include features
to improve their accessibility.

For a higher level overview of how to get started, see the [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)

## Component Overview

All components have been developed with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) as part of the
[MyVic-Components](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/myvic-components) repository and aligned to the existing
[Ripple](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple) component library. Components are published to NPM, ready to be used
directly in any Vue JS application.

[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) is recommended for bootstrapping a new standalone Vue JS application.

[Ripple](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple) includes example Vue JS and Nuxt sites that can be used to bootstrap a web
application for deployment to [SDP](https://www.singledigitalpresence.vic.gov.au/).

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) examples with component documentation are available
[here](https://visualise.myvictoria.vic.gov.au/)

## Installation

Installation is straightforward with NPM or Yarn. See the component listing for all available packages.

```shell
npm install @dpc-sdp/myvic-bar-chart --save
```

or

```shell
yarn add @dpc-sdp/myvic-bar-chart
```

## Usage

All components are published to NPM as individual packages under the @dpc-sdp namespace, with a myvic- prefix. For
example:

- @dpc-sdp/myvic-map-core
- @dpc-sdp/myvic-bar-chart

Components are intended to be used with Vue.js projects, and can be installed with NPM as follows:

```shell
npm install @dpc-sdp/myvic-map-core --save
```

And imported using ES6 style imports:

```javascript
import { MyvicMapCore } from '@dpc-sdp/myvic-map-core'
```

Or using require as follows:

```javascript
const MyvicMapCore = require("@dpc-sdp/myvic-map-core")
```

Or imported directly into an HTML page (see the UMD Bundle documentation for more information:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@dpc-sdp/myvic-bundle@dev/dist/myvic-bundle.js"></script>
```
