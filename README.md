<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Your Victoria component library aims to enable the publication of accessible maps, charts and user interface (UI)
elements to websites by content owners across Government. It includes a set of reusable UI components designed to
integrate with DDIâ€™s existing ecosystem of platforms and services; and supporting documentation and examples to assist
with their usage.

All components have been designed to align to Victorian Government design standards and branding; and include features
to improve their accessibility.

## Component Architecture

All components have been developed with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) as part of the
[Your Victoria](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/yourvictoria-vic-gov-au) repository and aligned to the existing
[Ripple](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple) component library. Components are published to NPM ready to be used
directly in any Vue JS application.

[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) is recommended for bootstrapping a new standalone Vue JS application.

[Ripple](https://github.com/dpc-sdp/ripple) includes examples Vue JS and Nuxt sites that can be used to bootstrap a web
application for deployment to [SDP](https://www.singledigitalpresence.vic.gov.au/).

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) examples with component documentation are available
[here](https://storybook-yourvictoria-vic-gov-au-develop.lagoon.vicsdp.amazee.io/)
